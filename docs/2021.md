## Keynote

**Speaker**: Dr. Bianca Kramer (Utrecht University Library)

Bianca Kramer is a scholarly communication librarian at [Utrecht University Library](https://www.uu.nl/en/university-library), with a strong focus on open science and open infrastructure. Through her work on the project ['101 innovations in scholarly communication'](https://101innovations.wordpress.com/) she investigates trends in innovations and tool usage across the research cycle, with special attention to open scholarly infrastructure. She researches and leads workshops on various aspects of scholarly communication (e.g. preprints, peer review, altmetrics) for researchers, students and other stakeholders in scholarly communication, and has an active interest in open access developments and monitoring, as well as in developments around rewards and recognition. She is on the board of [FORCE11](https://www.force11.org/) and was a member of the [EC Expert Group on the Future of Scholarly Communication and Scholarly Publishing](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/464477b3-2559-11e9-8d04-01aa75ed71a1).

### Talk: Open metadata - where do we stand? 

Metadata form an important part of the research communication ecosystem - allowing  discovery, linking and integration of data on research process and outputs, research evaluation and metaresearch. It can be argued that publications, data and other research objects can only be FAIR when their metadata are open, and while there are many organizations working on providing open metadata, a number of challenges remain. 
 
These include licensing issues, the existence of siloed collections of metadata and the continued commercial enclosure of certain types of metadata. There is also growing awareness of the need for transparency, provenance and community governance in open metadata collection and provision. Finally, there are questions around the pros and cons of centralization vs. distributed systems, and the role of community curation vs. authoritative sources of metadata. 
 
This presentation will discuss these aspects, highlight a number of current initiatives towards open metadata, and discuss where these can strengthen each other and which gaps and biases in the open metadata landscape remain to be addressed.

    "about": "Research data is the mirror of experimental work. It complements scientific publications and is core input to data driven research. Most research activities follow the research data cycle, where data is continuously used, modified and produced, transitioning from one research group to another. For this cycle to prosper, we require Research Data Management plans supporting the findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR) principles. Despite playing an important role, data on its own is not sufficient to establish Open Science nor Linked Open Science, i.e., Open Science plus Linked Open Data (LOD) principles. LOD principles, a.k.a. LOD 5 stars, follow objectives that overlap with FAIR principles such as 'openness' and the use of 'non-proprietary open formats'. In this workshop we will explore what is required for RDM to effectively instantiate Linked Open Science, including effective support for LOD, automation by, e.g., machine/deep learning approaches, and innovations to include supporting data elements such as the software used to produce/consume it or the tutorials showcasing usage and fostering further developments. Furthermore, data management should be complemented by other research objects management plans, e.g., software and workflows, in order to get an integrated layer supporting all the edges of Linked Open Science. In this workshop, we will focus on data management for Linked Open Science but we will also have opportunities to discuss how other research objects, i.e., other than data objects, play an important role.",
