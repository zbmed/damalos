# Submission process

## Types of submissions
* Full research papers (up to 10 pages): Presenting novel scientific research 
* Short research papers (up to 6 pages): Presenting research results at early stages or ongoing work
* Position papers (up to 6 pages): Introducing positions, ideas, opinions and discussions around them
* Research objects (up to 10 pages): Describing datasets, software, workflows, training materials

## Guidelines
All submissions must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference/workshop. All submissions must be in English. Proceedings of the workshop will be publicly available under [CC-by 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/){:target="_blank"}; by submitting you agree to the use of this license for accepted papers. We welcome **full research** (introducing novel research contributions, max 10 pages), **short research** (presenting early results or work in progress, max 6 pages), **position** (introducing an idea and discussion around it, max 6 pages) and **research objects** (description of datasets, software, workflows, max 10 pages) papers formatted according to [LNCS templates](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines){:target="_blank"}

Submissions will be evaluated by members of the [Program Committee](./pc.md)

Accepted papers will be invited to submit an extended version to the [Journal of Biomedical Semantics (JBMS)](./jbms).

## Topics
 DaMaLOS targets the following (and similar) topics:

* Importance of Research Data Management (RDM) for LOD
* Special features/metadata required in RDM/ROM plans for LOD
* RDM/ROM plans elements/data that can be automated, particularly using/consuming LOD
* Links between RDM and ROM plans and how those could be automated
* Extensions to current RDM plans to better support Linked Open Science, e.g., emergence of ROM
* Integration/alignment between FAIR and RDM/ROM plans and tools
* Research and training initiatives related to RDM/ROM supporting Open Science/Linked Open Science
* Benefits of Linked Open Science, i.e., Open Science + Linked Open Data principles, over Open  Science
* How RDM/ROM plans and LOD can be used to improve collection and storage of (usually volatile) data produced at, e.g., conferences
* Managing FAIR digital objects in federated, open data spaces/infrastructures/ecosystems
* Gluing together metadata + publications + data + software, (e.g., via management plans, FAIRification efforts or open aggregating spaces/ecosystems)

## Submission system
All submissions should be done via [EasyChair DaMaLOS-2021 workshop](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=damalos2021){:target="_blank"}
