# Submission process

This year DaMaLOS welcomes submissions in the form of long (up to 12 pages) and short (up to 6 pages) research papers, research objects (up to 3 pages), position papers (up to 6 pages), demos (up to 3 pages), posters (up to 3 pages). References are not counted within the page limit. Please use numbered citations in sequential order, e.g., APA style, and whenever possible add a (DOI) link.

Accepted papers will go to the proceedings of the workshop and will be publicly available under CC-by 4.0 license at [PUBLISSO FRL](https://repository.publisso.de/){:target="_blank"}Â indexed by [LIVIVO](https://www.livivo.de/) and [DBLP](https://dblp.org/search?q=damalos). PUBLISSO mints DOIs and provides a fast publication process that will allow us to have the proceedings ready right after the conference, including slides. Accepted workshop papers aligned with Life Sciences or domain-agnostic will be later invited to submit an extended and improved version to the Journal of Biomedical Semantics ([JBMS](./jbms)).

### Types of submissions
* Full research papers (up to 12 pages): Presenting novel scientific research
* Short research papers (up to 6 pages): Presenting research results at early stages
* Position papers (up to 6 pages): Introducing positions, ideas, opinions and discussions around a topic
* Research objects (up to 3 pages): Describing datasets, software, workflows, training materials together with their metadata
* Demos (up to 3 pages): Presenting tools (software, workflows and so) from a practical perspective
* Posters (up to 3 pages): Presenting works in a graphical display


### Guidelines
All submissions must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference/workshop. All submissions must be in English. Proceedings of the workshop will be publicly available under [CC-by 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/){:target="_blank"}; by submitting you agree to the use of this license for accepted papers. Papers should be formatted according to [LNCS templates](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines){:target="_blank"}.

### Submission system
All workshop submissions should be done via [DaMaLOS-2025 submission system](https://app.oxfordabstracts.com/stages/77706/submitter){:target="_blank"}

## Topics
 DaMaLOS targets the following (and similar) topics:

* Research management
  * Importance, automatization and connections across Research Data and Software (and other digital objects) Management for Linked Open Science (LOS,  i.e., Open Science + Linked Open Data principles)
  * Special features/metadata required in research management plans for LOS
  * Extensions to current RDM plans to better support LOS
* FAIRness and FAIRification
  * Integration/alignment between FAIR and research management plans
  * FAIRification processes, either by design or post-research-object creation
  * FAIR tooling, e.g., evaluators, extensions, governance
  * RO-Crates, Signposting and FDOs
* Open Science and Scientometrics
  * Benefits of LOS over Open Science
  * How research plans and LOS can be used to improve collection and storage of (usually volatile) data produced at, e.g., conferences
  * Integration of software, data, and other research outcomes into science-related metrics
