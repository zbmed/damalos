# Submission process

## Journal permanent collection at JBioMedSem

The [Journal of Biomedical Semantics](https://www.biomedcentral.com/){:target="_blank"} hosts a [DaMaLOS permanent collection](https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/damalos){:target="_blank"}. This year we will welcome direct submissions to the journal collection for those researchers with a topic mature enough for peer-reviwed publication. If you opt for this option, please visit the [submission guideline](https://jbiomedsem.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines){:target="_blank"} provided by the journal. Make sure you select the DaMaLOS collection when submitting. 

JBioMedSem offers a preprint server for submission to the journal while the peer-reviwed process is ongoing. 

For those submitting to the journal track, we would also expect them to join, participate and present their works at the workshop.

## Workshop track

Authors can also go for a workshop submission as in previous years, an ideal option for ongoing research and position papers.

### Types of submissions
* Full research papers (up to 10 pages): Presenting novel scientific research 
* Research objects (up to 10 pages): Describing datasets, software, workflows, training materials
* Short research papers (up to 6 pages): Presenting research results at early stages or ongoing work
* Position papers (up to 6 pages): Introducing positions, ideas, opinions and discussions around them
* Demos (up to 6 pages): Presenting tools (software, workflows and so) from a practical perspective


### Guidelines
All submissions must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference/workshop. All submissions must be in English. Proceedings of the workshop will be publicly available under [CC-by 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/){:target="_blank"}; by submitting you agree to the use of this license for accepted papers. We welcome **full research** (introducing novel research contributions, max 10 pages), **short research** (presenting early results or work in progress, max 6 pages), **position** (introducing an idea and discussion around it, max 6 pages) and **research objects** (description of datasets, software, workflows, max 10 pages) papers formatted according to [LNCS templates](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines){:target="_blank"}

Submissions will be evaluated by members of the [Program Committee](./pc.md)

Accepted papers will be invited to submit an extended version to the [Journal of Biomedical Semantics (JBMS)](./jbms).

### Submission system
All workshop submissions should be done via [EasyChair DaMaLOS-2022 workshop](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=damalos2022){:target="_blank"}

## Topics
 DaMaLOS targets the following (and similar) topics:

* Research management
  * Importance of Research Data Management (RDM) for LOD
  * Importance of other Research Objects Management (ROM) and their alignment with RDM and LOD
  * Special features/metadata required in RDM/ROM plans for LOD
  * RDM/ROM plans elements/data that can be automated, particularly using/consuming LOD
  * Links between RDM and ROM plans and how those could be automated
  * Extensions to current RDM plans to better support Linked Open Science, e.g., emergence of ROM
* FAIRness and FAIRification
  * Integration/alignment between FAIR and RDM/ROM plans and tools
  * FAIRification processes, either by design or post-research-object creation
  * FAIR tooling
* Open Science and Scientometrics
  * Benefits of Linked Open Science, i.e., Open Science + Linked Open Data principles, over Open Science
  * How RDM/ROM plans and LOD can be used to improve collection and storage of (usually volatile) data produced at, e.g., conferences
  * Integration of software, data, and any other research outcome into science-related metrics
* Virtual Research Environments
  * Managing FAIR digital objects in federated, open data spaces/infrastructures/ecosystems
  * Gluing together metadata + publications + data + software, (e.g., via management plans, FAIRification efforts or open aggregating spaces/ecosystems)
