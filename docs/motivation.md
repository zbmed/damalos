# Motivation

Research data is the mirror of experimental work. It complements scientific publications and is core input to data driven research. Most research activities follow the research data cycle, where data is continuously used, modified and produced, transitioning from one research group to another. For this cycle to prosper, we require Research Data Management plans supporting the findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR) principles. Despite playing an important role, data on its own is not sufficient to establish Open Science nor Linked Open Science, i.e., Open Science plus Linked Open Data (LOD) principles. LOD principles, a.k.a. LOD 5 stars, follow objectives that overlap with FAIR principles such as “openness” and the use of “non-proprietary open formats”. In this workshop we will explore what is required for RDM to effectively instantiate Linked Open Science, including effective support for LOD, automation by, e.g., machine/deep learning approaches, and innovations to include supporting data elements such as the software used to produce/consume it or the tutorials showcasing usage and fostering further developments. Furthermore, data management should be complemented by other research objects management plans, e.g., software and workflows, in order to get an integrated layer supporting all the edges of Linked Open Science. In this workshop, we will focus on data management for Linked Open Science but we will also have opportunities to discuss how other research objects, i.e., other than data objects, play an important role.
