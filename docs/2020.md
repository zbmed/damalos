## Keynote

**Title**: <a href="https://repository.publisso.de/resource/frl%3A6423950" target="_blank"><img src="../img/link.png" alt="Link"> The swings and roundabouts of a decade of fun and games with Research Objects</a>

**Speaker**: Prof. Dr. Carole Goble (The University of Manchester)

### Abstract

Over the past decade we have been working on the concept of [Research Objects](http://researchobject.org). We worked at the 20,000 feet level as a new form of FAIR+R scholarly communication and at the 5 feet level as a packaging approach for assembling all the elements of a research investigation, like the workflows, data and tools associated with a publication.  Even in our earliest papers [1] we recognised that there was more to success than just using Linked Data. We swung from fancy RDF models and SHACL that specialists could use to simple RO-Crates and JSON-LD that mortal programmers could use. Success depends on a use case need, a community and tools which we found particularly in the world of computational workflows right from the outset. All along there have been politics and that has recently got even hotter.  All fun and games!

### Prof. Dr. Carole Goble

Carole is a Professor of Computer Science at the University of Manchester. She is on the leadership team and the godmother of ResearchObject.org. Her team in the eScience Lab at the Manchester have a mission to disseminate knowledge about research objects, their concept and their adoption. She has spent 25 years working in e-Science on computational workflows, reproducible science, open sharing, and knowledge and metadata management in a range of discipline, especially in the life sciences where she was an early advocate of the Semantic Web/Linked Data. She has worked on numerous EU e-Infrastructure projects including Wf4ever which first developed the Research Object model. She is the co-founder of the UK’s Software Sustainability Institute and cares about quality research software and reproducibility by building platforms people actually use, including myExperiment.org and workflowhub.eu workflow repositories and the FAIRDOMHub.org for systems biology asset sharing all of which use Research Objects in some form. She is the co-lead of the interoperability platform for ELIXIR, the EU Research Infrastructure for Life Sciences and Head of Node of ELIXIR-UK. She was part of the founding of FORCE11 and an author of the infamous FAIR data paper. She serves on SWSA, was the OC of ISWC2014 and in 2020 serves as the co-chair of the Vision track.
