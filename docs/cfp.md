# Call for papers

DaMaLOS-2021 workshop (co-located with ISWC) will explore what is required for Research Data Management to effectively instantiate Linked Open Science, i.e., Open Science + Linked Open Data (LOD) principles, including effective support for LOD, automation by, e.g., machine/deep learning approaches, and innovations to include supporting data elements such as the software used to produce/consume it together with tutorials showcasing their usage. Furthermore, data management should be complemented by other research objects management plans, e.g. software and workflows, in order to get an integrated layer supporting all the edges of Linked Open Science. In this workshop we will keep a focus on data management but we will also have opportunities to discuss how other research objects play an important role.

We welcome **full research** (introducing novel research contributions, max 10 pages), **short research** (presenting early results or work in progress, max 6 pages), **position** (introducing an idea and discussion around it, max 6 pages) and **research objects** (description of datasets, software, workflows, max 10 pages) papers on the following (or similar) topics:

* Importance of Research Data Management (RDM) for LOD
* Special features/metadata required in RDM/ROM plans for LOD
* RDM/ROM plans elements/data that can be automated, particularly using/consuming LOD
* Links between RDM and ROM plans and how those could be automated
* Extensions to current RDM plans to better support Linked Open Science, e.g., emergence of ROM
* Integration/alignment between FAIR and RDM/ROM plans and tools
* Research and training initiatives related to RDM/ROM supporting Open Science/Linked Open Science
* Benefits of Linked Open Science, i.e., Open Science + Linked Open Data principles, over Open  Science
* How RDM/ROM plans and LOD can be used to improve collection and storage of (usually volatile) data produced at, e.g., conferences
* Managing FAIR digital objects in federated, open data spaces/infrastructures/ecosystems
* Gluing together metadata + publications + data + software, (e.g., via management plans, FAIRification efforts or open aggregating spaces/ecosystems)
