# Call for papers

DaMaLOS-2020 (ISWC co-located) workshop will explore what is required for Research Data Management to effectively instantiate Linked Open Science, i.e., Open Science + Linked Open Data (LOD) principles, including effective support for LOD, automation by, e.g., machine/deep learning approaches, and innovations to include supporting data elements such as the software used to produce/consume it together with tutorials showcasing their usage. Furthermore, data management should be complemented by other research objects management plans, e.g. software and workflows, in order to get an integrated layer supporting all the edges of Linked Open Science. In this workshop we will keep a focus on data management but we will also have opportunities to discuss how other research objects play an important role.

We welcome full (max 8 pages) and short/position (max 4 pages) papers on the following (or similar) topics:

* Importance of Research Data Management (RDM) for LOD
* Importance of other Research Objects Management (ROM) and their alignment with RDM and LOD
* Special features/metadata required in RDM plans for LOD
* RDM plans elements/data that can be automated, particularly for LOD
* Links between RDM and ROM plans and how those could be automated
* Extensions to current RDM plans to better support Linked Open Science, e.g., emergence of ROM
* Integration/alignment between FAIRness assessment tools and RDM/ROM plans/tools
* Research and training initiatives related to RDM/ROM supporting Open Science/Linked Open Science
* Benefits of Linked Open Science over Open Science
* How RDM/ROM plans and LOD can be used to improve collection and storage of (usually volatile) data produced at, e.g., conferences
* How and what data produced by RDM/ROM plans could be automatically integrated into knowledge graph initiatives such as Open Aire, Research Graph or Web of Science
