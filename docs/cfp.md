# Call for papers

DaMaLOS-2022 workshop (co-located with ISWC) will explore what is required for Research Data Management to effectively instantiate Linked Open Science, i.e., Open Science + Linked Open Data (LOD) principles, including effective support for LOD, automation by, e.g., machine/deep learning approaches, and innovations to include supporting data elements such as the software used to produce/consume it together with tutorials showcasing their usage. Furthermore, data management should be complemented by other research objects management plans, e.g. software and workflows, in order to get an integrated layer supporting all the edges of Linked Open Science. In this workshop we will keep a focus on data management but we will also have opportunities to discuss how other research objects play an important role.

We welcome **journal submissions** (if your research is mature enough for a journal submission, you can directly submit to our [journal permanent collection at JBioMedSem](https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/damalos){:target="_blank"}, please be aware that you would also be expected to attend to the workshop), and **workshop submissions** inlcuding *full research* (introducing novel research contributions, max 10 pages), *short research* (presenting early results or work in progress, max 6 pages), *position* (introducing an idea and discussion around it, max 6 pages) and *research objects* (description of datasets, software, workflows, training materials, max 10 pages) papers on the following (or similar) topics:

* Research management
  * Importance of Research Data Management (RDM) for LOD
  * Importance of other Research Objects Management (ROM) and their alignment with RDM and LOD
  * Special features/metadata required in RDM/ROM plans for LOD
  * RDM/ROM plans elements/data that can be automated, particularly using/consuming LOD
  * Links between RDM and ROM plans and how those could be automated
  * Extensions to current RDM plans to better support Linked Open Science, e.g., emergence of ROM
* FAIRness and FAIRification
  * Integration/alignment between FAIR and RDM/ROM plans and tools
  * FAIRification processes, either by design or post-research-object creation
  * FAIR tooling
* Open Science and Scientometrics
  * Benefits of Linked Open Science, i.e., Open Science + Linked Open Data principles, over Open Science
  * How RDM/ROM plans and LOD can be used to improve collection and storage of (usually volatile) data produced at, e.g., conferences
  * Integration of software, data, and any other research outcome into science-related metrics
* Virtual Research Environments
  * Managing FAIR digital objects in federated, open data spaces/infrastructures/ecosystems
  * Gluing together metadata + publications + data + software, (e.g., via management plans, FAIRification efforts or open aggregating spaces/ecosystems)
