# Journal of Biomedical Semantics
The [Journal of Biomedical Semantics (JBMS)](https://jbiomedsem.biomedcentral.com/){:target="_blank"} addresses issues of semantic enrichment and semantic processing in the biomedical domain. The scope of the journal covers two main areas:
* Infrastructure for biomedical semantics: focusing on semantic resources and repositories, meta-data management and resource description, knowledge representation and semantic frameworks, the Biomedical Semantic Web, and semantic interoperability, and
* semantic mining, annotation, and analysis: focusing on approaches and applications of semantic resources; and tools for investigation, reasoning, prediction, and discoveries in biomedicine.

JBMS hosts a permanent DaMaLOS collection. This year researchers an decided to directly submit to the journal (if the work is mature enough) or to the workshop (ongoing, early stages and similar work). Accepted workshop papers will be invited to submit an extended version to the DaMaLOS collection at JBMS.

__Important information__
All accepted workshop papers submitting an extended version to JBMS will still follow a peer-review process. Please be aware the journal version of a workshop published paper should include enough differences to be considered as an original contribution.
