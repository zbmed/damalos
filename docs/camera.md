# Camera-ready version

**This page only applies for submission to the workshop track**

## Guidelines

Camera-ready versions for accepted papers should be submitted via [EasyChair DaMaLOS-2023 workshop proceedings](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=damalos2023){:target="_blank"} as an update to the original submission. No authors should be added at this stage.

* Submission deadline (camera-ready version): 10th May 2023 (publication will be aligned with the actual workshop day)
* Reserved DOI: A DOI will be communicated directly to authors (particularly corresponding authors)
* Modifications to the LNCS template
  * No header on the first page
  * Header for even pages (2, 4, and so), aligned to the left (please cut the title as necessary to make it fit in one line, if cut please add ... at the end), see [Table 1](#table-1)
  * Header for odd pages (3, 5, and so), aligned to the right, see [Table 2](#table-2)
  * For example, please see the [editorial note from DaMaLOS 2020](https://repository.publisso.de/resource/frl:6424220/data){:target="_blank"}

**Note**: You will need to modify the template yourself (e.g., increase margins for headers) so the headers fit.

### Table 1

_Header for even pages, alignment to the left_

<table >
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align:left">#page-number Doe et al. (2023) Title of the article...</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Table 2

_Header for odd pages (except the first one), alignment to the right_

<table >
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align:right">DaMaLOS@ESWC. PUBLISSO-Fachrepositorium. DOI:assigned DOI #page-number</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## License

Proceedings of the workshop will be publicly available under [CC-by 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/){:target="_blank"} in [PUBLISSO-Fachrepositorium](https://repository.publisso.de/){:target="_blank"}, indexed by [BASE](https://www.base-search.net/){:target="_blank"}. By submitting you agree to the use of this license for accepted papers. You will be required to submit a signed agreement for publication.

## Journal submission

Accepted workshop papers will be invited to submit an extended version to the [Journal of Biomedical Semantics (JBMS)](./jbms). Please be aware that post-workshop submissions to the journal are expected to be original work showing some improvment/advancement regarding the workshop submission (i.e., you cannot submit the same text as it was accepted to the workshop and the journal version should be different enough).

## Submission system

All submissions should be done via [EasyChair DaMaLOS-2023 workshop proceedings](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=damalos2023){:target="_blank"}
