## Motivation

Scientific research involves various digital objects including publications, software, data, workflows and tutorials (i.e., research artifacts), all key to FAIRness, reproducibility and transparency. The research lifecycle, from questions and hypotheses to results and conclusions, requires data production, collection, and transformation, a process commonly supported by software, workflows and tutorials. For this cycle to prosper, we require Research Artifacts Management Plans (RMPs) including data, software, machine learning (DMPs, SMPs, MLMPs) and metadata supporting the [FAIR (data) principles](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618){:target="_blank"} and its extensions (e.g., [FAIR4RS](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01710-x){:target="_blank"}, [FAIR computational workflows](https://doi.org/10.1162/dint_a_00033){:target="_blank"}, [FAIR4ML](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/fair-machine-learning-fair4ml-ig){:target="_blank"}) as well as additional coverage for reproducibility, transparency, trustability, explainability, i.e., *ilities. All sorts of research artifacts are needed to fully realize Linked Open Science, i.e., Open Science plus Linked Open Data (LOD) principles –data here understood in a very broad sense covering any research artifact. LOD principles, aka [LOD 5 stars](https://5stardata.info/en/){:target="_blank"}, follow objectives overlapping with FAIR and Open Science (e.g., LOD includes “openness” and usage of “non-proprietary open formats”). In DaMaLOS we will explore requirements for research artifacts and their corresponding management plans to effectively instantiate an integrated layer supporting Linked Open Science. DaMaLOS welcomes contributions aligned to the following topics: use of metadata as background knowledge to improve LLMs, machine-actionable research artifact management plans; machine/deep learning and LLM approaches to enrich metadata; FAIR-assistance, FAIRification; FAIR by design (e.g., [Research Objects](https://www.researchobject.org/){:target="_blank"}, [SignPosting](https://signposting.org/){:target="_blank"}, [FDO](https://fairdo.org/){:target="_blank"}); FAIR tooling; and scientometrics beyond the scholarly publication (i.e., combining the different research artifacts for research assessment and impact).

## Audience

DaMaLOS targets researchers interested in the topics “science on science”, FAIRness of research artifacts, and research objects management, including for instance data and software management plans. DaMaLOS submissions and discussions commonly revolve around subjects such as creation of metadata schemas to represent research artifacts; applications consuming or exposing such metadata; machine/deep learning solutions to consume, improve or facilitate access to the metadata; FAIRification assistants and FAIRness evaluators; FAIR Digital Objects implementations, in particular those using technologies aligned to the Linked Open Data efforts (e.g., RO-Crates and Signposting), and scientometrics approaches using research artifacts beyond traditional scholarly publications.

        "description": "The European Semantic Web Conference is a major venue for discussing the latest scientific results and technology innovations around semantic technologies. Building on its past success, ESWC is seeking to broaden its focus to span other relevant related research areas in which Web semantics plays an important role. The goal of the Semantic Web is to create a Web of knowledge and services in which the semantics of content is made explicit and content is linked to both other content and services allowing novel applications to combine content from heterogeneous sites in unforeseen ways and support enhanced matching between users needs and content. This network of knowledge-based functionality will weave together a large network of human knowledge, and make this knowledge machine-processable to support intelligent behaviour by machines. Creating such an interlinked Web of knowledge which spans unstructured text, structured data  as well as multimedia content and services requires the collaboration of many disciplines, including but not limited to: Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, Databases and Information Systems, Information Retrieval, Machine Learning, Multimedia, Distributed Systems, Social Networks, Web Engineering, and Web Science. These complementarities are reflected in the outline of the technical program of the ESWC 2024. ESWC 2024 will present the latest results in research, technologies and applications in its field. Besides the technical program organized over numerous tracks, the conference will feature a workshop and tutorial program, system descriptions and demos, a posters exhibition and a doctoral symposium.",
